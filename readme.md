# BKM
Made for the **STAFF** of BroKits, provides tools and a quick menu for toggling settings the middle of PVP!

BKM is a 100% open-source project, BKM was made for brokits.minehut.gg as a fair advantage mod for all branches of PVP!
This includes CPVP, Sword/Axe PVP, and others. Feel free to change anything by yourself provided in the repo with a fork!

Normal users MAY NOT USE BKM, and will be considered an unfair advantage.
